# Sentence-Completion-using-Hidden-Markov-Models
The goal of this script is to implement three langauge models to perform sentence completion, i.e. given a sentence with a missing word to choose the correct one from a list of candidate words. The way to use a language model for this problem is to consider a possible candidate word for the sentence at a time and then ask the language model which version of the sentence is the most probable one.
